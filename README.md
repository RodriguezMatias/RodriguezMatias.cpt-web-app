# Deploy

Deploying using angular-cli-ghpages
Inside the sample folder, add the angular-cli-ghpages package using the following command:

ng add angular-cli-ghpages
Now, we can proceed to deploy.

The deploy command is simple, and we must add a base-href argument with the name of the repository in it:

ng deploy --base-href=/angular-app/
Here, the deploy command does all the work. We donâ€™t have to manually build or commit those files.

Once this command finishes running, check the files in the repository using:

https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>
We can see the hosted corresponding site at the following link:

https://<username>.github.io/<repositoryname>
The <username> refers to our GitHub username and <repositoryname> refers to the name of the repository created on GitHub.
